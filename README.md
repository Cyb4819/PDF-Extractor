ðŸ“„ PDF Content Extractor â€“ Text & Image Parser for Complex PDFs
Description:
This project is designed to automatically extract and classify text and images from complex PDF documents, including both standard and scanned/image-based files. It intelligently processes headers, footers, text blocks, and embedded imagesâ€”leveraging OCR for non-searchable contentâ€”and outputs results in a structured JSON format. All images are saved in organized folders by page, enabling easy access and further processing.
